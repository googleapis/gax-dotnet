# Script to perform a release build for GAX, based on
# a commit for which tags have been created.
# This builds both GAX and the common protos; but will delete
# all built packages that don't match one of the tags in the commit
# hash. For instance, if there's only one tag in the commit hash 
# that starts with Google.Api.Gax.Grpc then only the following nuget
# packages will remain after the script is done:
# Google.Api.Gax.Grpc.<version>.nupkg
# Google.Api.Gax.Grpc.Gcp.<version>.nupkg
# Google.Api.Gax.Grpc.Testing.<version>.nupkg
# Sample: buildrelease.sh 847118821d8a8b4ac2ea3bbe692acea29c14c4da

# The repo is cloned into a fresh "releasebuild" directory.
