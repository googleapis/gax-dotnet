Google API Extensions for .NET
===

This repository contains code for support libraries for the
[Google Cloud Libraries for
.NET](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-dotnet).
See the [API
reference](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-dotnet/docs/api/Google.Api.Gax.html)
and [API
layers](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-dotnet/docs/api-layers.html)
documentation for more details of how these support libraries are
used.

Application code will rarely need to use most of the classes within this
library directly, but code generated automatically from the [API definition
files](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/)
can use services such as page streaming to provide
a more convenient and idiomatic API surface to callers.
