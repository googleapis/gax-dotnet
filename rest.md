Google REST API Extensions for .NET
===

The [primary library](readme.md) for this repository is
`Google.Api.Gax`, which provides support for gRPC-based APIs.
However, there are many older Google APIs based on
REST/JSON/HTTP1.1. These have their own [support
library](https://github.com/google/google-api-dotnet-client).
However, that support library does not provide functionality
required by some of the [wrapper client
libraries](https://github.com/google-cloud-platform/google-cloud-dotnet).
The `Google.Api.Gax.Rest` library fills in these blanks, providing
some similar APIs to those in `Google.Api.Gax`.

Supported platforms
---

We are initially targeting support for .NET 4.5. We hope to support
.NET Core in the future, when all the dependencies do.
